# Part 3 Writing the Program in C#

1. Replicate the functionality of the enrollment management program developed in part 2 using the C# programming language.
   -  Verify that the output produced by your C# program matches the output generated by the program developed in Part 2. This includes the format, content and accuracy of any messages, prompts or results displayed to the user.
2. Include comments and descriptive variable names within your C# code to enhance readability and maintainability. Explain any complex logic or decision-making processes to facilitate understanding for yourself and others who may review the code.
3. Test your C# program to ensure its correctness, functionality and compatibility with the specified requirements.
   - Compare the output of your C# program with the output of the program developed in Part 2 to validate consistency and correctness across both implementations.
