# Part 2 – Writing in Java

1. Set up your development environment and create a new project.
2. Create Java classes for Employee, PartTimeEmployee, FullTimeEmployee, and other specific roles and departments as defined in the UML diagram.
3. Include the following in your prototype:
   - Inheritance: Implement inheritance by creating a base Employee class and extending it for PartTimeEmployee and FullTimeEmployee.
   - Encapsulation: Use private fields and provide public getter and setter methods.
   - Abstraction: Use abstract classes or interfaces where applicable.
   - Polymorphism: Implement method overriding to demonstrate polymorphism.
   - Binding: Demonstrate static binding with overloaded methods and dynamic binding with overridden methods. 
4. Create custom exception classes to handle specific errors (e.g., InvalidDataException).
   - Use try-catch blocks to handle exceptions and provide meaningful error messages.
5. Create a class that implements the Runnable interface for tasks that need to run in parallel, such as reading and writing employee data to a file.
6. Create a main class to test the program.
   - Use various test cases to ensure the program handles all edge cases and errors gracefully.
